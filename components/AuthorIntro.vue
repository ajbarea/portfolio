      I'm AJ and I'm learning how to code. If you want to get to know a bit about me you're in the 
      right place! This page houses an abridged timeline of my programming journey. I've built a 
      seperate page dedicated to my <a href="https://ajbarea.github.io/resume/"><em>Resume</em></a> 
      for recruiters or those interested in a more concise career outline. 
      If you'd like to see some of what I've been working on check out the 
      <a href="/projects"><em>Projects</em></a> page, or if you're more interested in any personal 
      thoughts I might share head to the <a href="/blog"><em>Blog</em></a>. 
      Either way, thanks for being here and sharing this experience with me.
