    title: "Control of Mobile Robots",
    description: `This repository showcases my exploration of mobile robot control systems, developed during the Control of Mobile Robots course at USF.  Each of the six labs delves into the design and implementation of control systems using microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators.  These systems enable the robots to localize themselves within a simulated environment and navigate effectively.  World files provide detailed maps with specific landscapes and dimensions for the robots to explore.  Written entirely in Python, the code is designed to run on the free Webots software by Cyberbotics.  To gain a deeper understanding of my design choices and thought process, check out the accompanying video explanations on my YouTube channel.  This project highlights my proficiency in Python programming and my interest in robotics control systems.`,
